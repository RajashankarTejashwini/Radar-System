# Automated Distance Measurement Scanner
Project Overview
The Automated Distance Measurement Scanner is an Arduino-based project that employs a servo motor to rotate an ultrasonic sensor, enabling it to measure distances at various angles. This system is designed for applications that require precise environmental scanning, such as robotics, automated guidance systems, and security surveillance, providing a comprehensive spatial understanding of the surroundings.

Features
Angular Scanning: The servo motor rotates the ultrasonic sensor from 15 to 165 degrees, allowing it to scan a wide area.

Real-Time Data Logging: Measures and logs distance data in real-time via the Arduino's serial port, which can be used for further analysis.

Customizable: Users can modify the scan range and speed by adjusting the code parameters.

Low Cost and Accessible: Utilizes commonly available components that are easy to assemble and program.
